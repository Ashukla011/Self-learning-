"""
 When you run the file hello_world.py, the ending .py indicates that the file is a 
Python program.Your editor then runs the file through the Python 
interpreter, which reads through the program and determines what each word 
in the program means. For example, when the interpreter sees the word 
print followed by parentheses, it prints to the screen whatever is inside the 
parentheses.
As you write your programs, your editor highlights different parts of 
your program in different ways. For example, it recognizes that print() is 
the name of a function and displays that word in one color. It recognizes 
that "Hello Python world!" is not Python code, and displays that phrase in a 
different color. This feature is called syntax highlighting and is quite useful 
as you start to write your own programs
