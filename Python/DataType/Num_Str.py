# in python , We have 4 different data types

# 1. Numeric Data Type

# The numeric data type is used in python to represent and work work with numerical numbers. "Integers" (int) and "floating-point numbers" (float) are two primary categories of numberic data types

x = 2
y = 3

#Additoin
sum = x+y
print(f"sum:", sum)

#subtractoin
difference = x-y
print(f"difference", difference)

# Mulitplicaton 
product = x*y
print(f"mulitpilication", product)

# division 
quotient = x/y
print(f"Quotient:", quotient)

# Floating-point number
pi = 3.14
temp = -6.5
dist = 1.5

# Text data type

message = "hello, Avnish"

# connecting the string 
age = 30
name = "Avnish"

f_info = f"Name :{name} , age:{age}"

# Accessing characters in string"
str = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

first_letter = name[0]
print(f"first letter", first_letter)
