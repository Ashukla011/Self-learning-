# 1. Arithmetic operatos
'''
+ Additon
- Subtraction
/ Division
% Modulus
** Exponetiation
// Floor Division
'''

# 2. Comparison 
'''
== Equal to 
!= Not Equal to 
> Greateer than 
< Less than 
>= Greater than or equal to 
*<= Less than or equal to 

'''

# 3.Assignment operators:
'''
+=, -=, *=, /=, %= , compound Assignment
'''

# 4. Bitwiese Operators:

'''
& Bitwiese AND
| Bitwiese OR
^ Bitwise XOR
'''

# 5 Membership operator 
'''
These operator test if a value if a member a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string)
Symbols work:
"in" Return "true" if the vlaue is found in the sequence
"not in " Return "true" if the value is not found in the sequence
'''

# 6. identify operators:
'''
these operators compare the memory addresses of two objects
sysmbols works;

is : Return "True" if both variable point to the same object 
is not: Return 'ture' if the variable points to difference object
